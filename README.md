# Tap Hub

Tap Hub is a mobile-first “tap-to-engage” web experience for our church that opens instantly from an NFC tag or QR code. It includes a **Public Hub** and an **Admin Hub**.

## Public Hub
A simple, fast site visitors and members can use without logging in to:
- View today’s announcements and weekly initiatives
- Browse upcoming events and service info (kids/nursery)
- Take quick actions via CTAs like **RSVP**, **sign up**, **give**, and **feedback**

Content is designed to be week-by-week and always current.

## Admin Hub (`/admin`)
A protected portal for pastors and auxiliary leaders to:
- Create and edit events and announcements
- Submit items for approval and request changes
- Approve and publish content to the Public Hub
- Keep events in sync with Google Calendar (e.g., update placeholders when approved/published)

**Goal:** eliminate scattered QR codes and keep church communication accurate with minimal admin effort.
